This theme supports the display of clearlogo artwork in Arctic Zephyr 2, by enabling it at:

This theme will use the skin's highlight color in its accent palette, so it's recommended to set it for the best experience:
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Highlight color`

Another consideration is the viewtype used for browsing, so for visual continuity, it's recommended that one of the following viewtypes be used:
