To install this theme in Seren, navigate to:

`Seren -> Settings -> Theme Manager -> Install Theme -> Web Location`

And enter the following URL:
https://www.github.com/drinfernoo/seren.theme.az2/zipball/master/

You can also download the `.zip` file directly from the same URL, and install it from:

`Seren -> Settings -> Theme Manager -> Install Theme -> Browse`

This theme respects various settings from Arctic Zephyr 2, including:
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Furniture -> Library location`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Furniture -> Section name`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Furniture -> Clock and weather`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Furniture -> Clearlogo`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Highlight color`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Geometric pattern on panels`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Library -> Mirror mediainfo viewtypes`
* `Settings -> Skin Settings -> Library -> Landscape art`

Also, if the theme is used on a setup with the Artwork Helper add-on installed, and "Extra Fanart" enabled in the AZ2 topbar,
multiple fanarts wll be cycled randomly as the backdrop for this theme. This functionality currently **does not** support different
"autoscroll" timings in AZ2.

For visual continuity, it's recommended that one of the following viewtypes be used:
* Media Info - 501
* Info Wall - 514
